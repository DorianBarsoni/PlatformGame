# PlatformGame
Basic game platform made with Unity and Mario's assets.

You can simply play the Game by downloading the code, going in the Output folder and launching the PlatformGame.exe.

# Assets
The assets I used come from the HelloFanGaming website. You can find the assets at this link : https://hellofangaming.github.io/HelloMarioAssets/
